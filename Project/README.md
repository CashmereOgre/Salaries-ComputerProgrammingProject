Project for Computer Programming laboratories, that I did on 4th semester. It is salaries calculator, with database assigned to it. User can add worker to database, display all workers, diplay all salaries of every worker or particular one, add salary to a certain worker. Project was done with use of C#, Windows Forms, Entity Framework and LINQ.
